# [And a Madman Mumbled][0] available on Audible.com

_And a Madman Mumbled: Tales from the Mind of H. David Blalock_
runs the genre gamut, taking listeners into worlds that will hopefully 
never exist and through fevered dreams that we only hope are just 
nightmares. Blalock carefully crafts each and every tale to thrill, 
excite, involve, and engage. Encounter creatures and stories both 
strange and familiar, and some even both, in _And a Madman Mumbled: Tales from the Mind of H. David Blalock_, from Pro Se Productions.
